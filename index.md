Welcome to the **unofficial EmoTracker documentation**! I guess! [EmoTracker](https://emotracker.net/) is a program mainly focused on tracking *randomizer* playthroughs, helping organize and visualize items, locations, and other things. It relies on *packs* created by other people for most of its functionality.

Want to see (and search through) the Discord messages? Check the [online archive of EmoTracker's Discord](https://xkeeper.net/private/emotracker-discord/). Unofficial, of course. :)

You know what they say: if you want something done right...

@TODO hey can you add a programmatic table of contents to github pages? :')

## Getting Started

When you first open the program, you will be told you have no installed packages. Good news: That's easy to fix!

### Installing Packages

Packages are installed by clicking the **![Package Manager](images/packages.png) Package Manager** icon at the top right of the window. You can search for a given game or package name and install it.

### Manual Package Management

Installed packages are saved in your `Documents\EmoTracker\packs` folder.

To install a package manually, place its zip file in that folder.

For development, you can place a folder in this directory with the extracted contents of the pack, e.g. `Documents\EmoTracker\packs\cool-new-pack`.


### Choosing A Package

Clicking the **![Settings](images/settings.png) Settings** icon in the top right of the window will allow you to choose a package to use. Some packs also support multiple trackers (e.g. normal, 'keysanity', 'entrance randomizer', etc).


## Tracking

<img src="images/map-example.png" alt="Example of a pack's tracker and map" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 0 1em;">

Most trackers will supply a map with *locations* or *checks* to help keep track of what you have or have not seen yet.

Checks are typically color coded:


<table id="accessibility-key" style="width: unset;">
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th colspan="2" class='c'>Color</th>
			<th class='c'>Meaning</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td class='r'>
				<div class="accessibility-dot accessibility-normal"></div>
			</td>
			<td>Green</td>
			<td>Fully accessible.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class='r'>
				<div class="accessibility-dot accessibility-sequencebreak"></div>
			</td>
			<td>Yellow</td>
			<td><em>Potentially</em> accessible. Might require sequence breaks, glitches, or specific key routing.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class='r'>
				<div class="accessibility-dot accessibility-inspect"></div>
			</td>
			<td>Blue</td>
			<td>Can be inspected; visible, but not accessible.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class='r'>
				<div class="accessibility-dot accessibility-none"></div>
			</td>
			<td>Red</td>
			<td>Inaccessible.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class='r'>
				<div class="accessibility-dot accessibility-partial"></div>
			</td>
			<td>Orange</td>
			<td>Partially accessible; mixture of the above.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class='r'>
				<div class="accessibility-dot accessibility-cleared"></div>
			</td>
			<td>Gray</td>
			<td>Cleared.</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

**I'm colorblind and/or these colors are hard to read. Help!**

You can change the colors used for locations. See [Customizing > Changing colors used for tracking](customizing#changing-colors-used-for-tracking).


### Tracking

By default, only accessible, un-cleared locations are visible; any locations marked as <div class="accessibility-dot accessibility-none"></div> Inaccessible or <div class="accessibility-dot accessibility-cleared"></div> Cleared will not appear on the map. This can be changed by toggling the *‚öôÔ∏è &rarr; Tracking &rarr; Show All Locations* option (or by pushing F11).


To interact with the tracker:

* *Right* click a location to mark it as <div class="accessibility-dot accessibility-cleared"></div> Cleared.
* *Double click* a location to pin it.
* <img src="images/location-popup.png" alt="Image of a location popup menu" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 0 1em;"> *Left click **and hold*** on a location to open a small popup. (If you release the button while the cursor is in the popup area, it will stay open.)
	* *Left* clicking on a check will mark it as cleared (or increment its counter, depending).
	* *Right* clicking on a check will unmark it. *Note that this is the **opposite** behavior outside of this popup!*
	* Clicking the üìå icon will pin or unpin the location.
	* Clicking the üìù icon will open *another* popup that allows you to add notes.
		* Click the (+) button to add a new note.
		* Click the "‚úèÔ∏è Edit Markdown" to be able to enter text. *(This text is only visible if you click the üìù button again.)*
		* There is an empty square at the right that can be used to add extra marks to a location. (These marks are visible in the tracker when hovering over the location, and can be removed by clicking the small trash icon that appears when hovering over them in this menu.)
		* Notes can be deleted by using the üóë Trash icon.

Example of adding and removing notes on a location:

<img src="images/tedium.gif" class="c" alt="GIF example of adding and removing notes on a location" title="you might ask yourself, why do you have to click a button to enable the textbox, instead of just having an empty text box? it's a good question, and not at all an example of how tedious using this can be">

Some trackers or locations may allow you to assign an additional icon to a location, which can be useful for locations that are visible but not accessible, or for tracking which location goes where.

<img src="images/location-tracking.gif" class="c" alt="GIF example of a location having a separate place to mark an item" title="the fun part is when you check the location off, it also deletes the additional mark you made. maybe there's a feature to turn that off. i should check the documentation! oh wait. lol">


You can also disable logic checks by choosing *‚öôÔ∏è &rarr; Tracking &rarr; Ignore All Logic*, which is ~~how you end up with Discord documentation~~ useful if you need to change a mark that you accidentally set, or if the tracker's logic is incorrect. 

The *‚öôÔ∏è &rarr; Layout* menu may have additional options for swapping the left and right sides of a tracker, showing or hiding the map, or more.


### Shortcuts and Hotkeys

* **Ctrl-S**: Saves the current tracker state.
* **Ctrl-Shift-S**: Same, but allows you to choose a filename.
* **Ctrl-O**: Opens a saved tracker state.
* **Ctrl-Z**: Undo
* **Ctrl-Mousewheel**: Zoom in/out.
* **Ctrl-0** (zero): Reset zoom level.
* **F1**: Opens the current pack's documentation URL.
* **F2**: Opens the *Broadcast View* window.
* **F5**: Reset tracker to its initial state, including any tracker-specific options.
* **F11**: Toggle showing *all* locations, including inaccessible or cleared ones.
