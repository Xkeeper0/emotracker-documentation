emotracker unofficial documentation
===================================

"i consider discord to be the de facto documentation and support system"

it's ok, you can have your wrong opinions


anyway this is a github pages thing, go look at the pages instead. pretend i linked them here instead of [the discord logs](https://xkeeper.net/private/emotracker-discord/) or something
